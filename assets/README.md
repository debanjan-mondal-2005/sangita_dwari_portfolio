## How to Add Your Photos:

1. **Prepare your photos:**

   - Rename your about section photo to `about-photo.jpg`
   - Make sure they're in JPG or PNG format

2. **Upload to this folder:**
   - Copy both images into this `assets` folder
   - Replace any existing placeholder images

3. **Test your website:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Check if both images display correctly
   - If images don't show, refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

## Image Tips:

✅ **Good Photo Practices:**
- Use high-resolution images (at least 400x400 for profile)
- Ensure good lighting
- Professional attire (nursing uniform is great!)
- Clean, uncluttered background
- Friendly, professional expression

❌ **Avoid:**
- Blurry or low-quality images
- Cropped or stretched photos
- Dark or poorly lit images
- Busy or distracting backgrounds

## File Naming:

The HTML is already configured to look for these exact file names:
- `profile-photo.jpg` or `profile-photo.png`
- `about-photo.jpg` or `about-photo.png`

If you use PNG format, update the file extensions in `index.html` lines 45 and 83.

## Need Help?

If your photos aren't displaying:
1. Check the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure photos are in the `assets` folder
3. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)
